# Matrix Reducer

This application is a simple 2x3 matrix reducer. It solves two systems of equations, each with two variables via the method of row reduction.

## Constraints
- This application must take two systems of equations.
- Each equation must have two variables.
- This application cannot take fractions as inputs, but it can take decimals.

For example, the following two equations would be <strong>valid</strong>:
<br>3x + 0.5y = 15
<br>x - 2y = -8

The following two equations would be <strong>invalid</strong>:
<br>4x + 0y = 16
<br>-2y = 8
